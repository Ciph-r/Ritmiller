      <p class="text-large">
        Will you play it safe or be greedy and keep rolling for a higher score?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="text-bold">Objective:</span> Be the first player to reach a
        score of 10,000+ points to win.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="text-bold">Starting the game:</span> You need at least two
        players, six six-sided dice and a scorepad. All players roll a die to
        determine who goes first. The high roller starts the game, and it
        proceeds clockwise through the players. First, roll all six dice,
        attempting to score at least 1,000 points to get “on board.” You must
        keep rolling until you get at least 1,000 points or lose it all. Once
        you have scored the initial 1,000 points you can stop rolling at any
        point on your next turns to build up your score trying to reach the goal
        of 10,000.
      </p>
      <p>You must keep at least one die each time you roll.</p>
      <p>
        If a player does not roll a scoring combination on their turn, their
        turn is over. If a player rolls a scoring combination they can opt to
        keep the points and “stop” their roll to add to their score or be greedy
        and keep rolling to gain higher points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are “on board” and the person playing to your right is also “on
        board” and they score points and stop their turn, you can keep rolling
        their remaining dice to keep adding to the score they’ve already made.
        If the person before your turn is “on board” but you aren’t, you cannot
        keep rolling to add to their points.
      </p>
      <p class="text-bold">Scoring rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1=100 points</li>
        <li>5=50 points</li>
        <li>
          3 of a kind= 100 x the number on the die (Exception: Three 1’s rolled
          at once = 1,000 points)
        </li>
        <li>
          4 of a kind= 200 x the number on the die (Example: Four 4’s rolled
          =800 or four 6’s rolled= 1,200 points, Exception: Four 1’s rolled at a
          time = 2,000.)
        </li>
        <li>
          On the initial roll of a players turn, three pairs rolled or a run of
          1-6= 1,000 points.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <span class="text-bold">Winning:</span>
        The game ends when the first player reaches a score of 10,000+ points.
        Once that score is achieved, all the other players have a single chance
        to beat the score by adding to the current points. (Once a player gets
        10,000+ points and is “out”, the player after them cannot keep rolling
        on their scored points. You must keep rolling until you beat the score
        or loose it all.
